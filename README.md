# French Licence Plate dataset

![Overview](ressources/overview.png)

This dataset as been annotated by myself in the Pascal-VOC format using LabelImg.

The dataset is composed of 211 images of which 89.5% of them are for training and the rest of 10.5% are for validation. Since the dataset is relatively small, it is encouraged to fine-tune a preexisting model with this dataset.

|            |  Train |  Test  | Total |
|:----------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|
|    Size    |   189  |   22   |  211  |
| Percentage | 89.5 % | 10.5 % | 100 % |

I tried to make this dataset as much mixed as I can by finding differents car angles.
